## What it does

FriendlyNeighbor presents the information of Disability Insurance and Term Life Insurance in a more creative and user-friendly way. We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Bootstrap) for the frontend, Java Springboot for the backend, and cockroachDB for the database. We also used Twilio's APIs to enhance the user experience.
